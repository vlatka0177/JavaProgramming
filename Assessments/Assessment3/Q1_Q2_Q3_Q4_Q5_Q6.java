        Q1
        Methods cannot be created in other methods.

        Q2
        There are two types of methods. Void methods will not return anything, but
        return type methods must return A value.

        Q3
        A method can have the same name as the class.

        Q4
        When A method has parameters, those arguments must be given when calling the
        method.

        Q5
        It is possible to overload A method by changing the number of parameters or
        data-types of the parameters and keeping the same method name.

        Q6
        A method cannot be overloaded by changing the return type and keeping the same method name.
        Method overloading has nothing to do with A return type.
