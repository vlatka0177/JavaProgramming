        Switch Statement: switch, case, default, break

        syntax:

        switch(Data){

            case data1:
                Statements;
                break;

             case data2:
                Statements;
                break;

             default:
                Statements;
                break;
        }

        Switch statement does not accept the following data types:
        long number = 9L
        float number = 9F
        double number = 9D
        boolean number = true

        Case value MUST match with switch data type and MUST be unique.

        Break is used for exiting the switch.
        If no break statement, switch statement continues to execute the next block(s)
        until the break statement or } of the switch.

        Default block gets executed if none of the case blocks match.
        There can only be one default block. It can be placed anywhere in case statements.

        OR logic can be used to switch by declaring case blocks back to back.
