    /*
    Custom Class is used for creating objects, and not for running. Thus, no Main Method is needed.

    Class
    - A template or A set of instructions to build A specific type of Object
    - Specifies what the object should contain and how it should behave
    - No memory is allocated for A class
    - Class can exist without objects

    ex.
    Dog ==> Class

    Breed
    Size ==> Fields (Attributes)
    Age
    Color

    Eat()
    Sleep() ==> Method (Actions)
    Sit()
    Run()

    Object
    - An instance of A class that stores data called fields.
    - Each object has its own memory.
    - Multiple objects can be created from A class.

    Instance Variables
    - Declared inside the class and outside any methods/blocks
    - Each Object has A separate copy of instance variable.

    Writing A Custom Class

    Instance Methods
    - Do not have A static specifier. Static would make the action applicable to all objects in A class.
    - Belong to the object
    - Each Object has A separate copy of the instance methods

    Creating an Object/Instance
    - The new keyword is used to create an instance of A class

     Object Name    Constructor
          |          |
    Dog dog1 = new Dog;
     |           |
    Class Name  Keyword
