    Object Oriented Programming

    Encapsulation
    - Hiding the data

    Inheritance
    - Creating IS A relation between classes (parent/super and child/sub)
    - Common features are created one time in the parent class, and are then inherited by the child class
    - Easy to maintain
    - Method Overriding
          - Gives multiple, different implementations to the method

     Polymorphism

     ABSTRACTION

     - Process of hiding implementation details from the user
     - Only the functionality will be provided to the user
     - Focusing on the essential qualities of something rather than one specific example.
       (Ignoring the irrelevant and unimportant)
     - User will have information on what the object does instead of how it does it

     ABSTRACT METHOD
     - Method without the body (implementation)
     - Abstract keyword is used to create it
         - public abstract void eat();
         - public abstract double calculate();
     - Meant to be overridden
         - final and static method cannot be overridden
     - Cannot have private access modifier
     - Can only be created in an abstract class or in an interface

     ABSTRACT CLASS
     - a parent/super class
     - provides reusable variables and methods to child/subclasses
     - abstract keyword creates abstract class
     - it cannot be instantiated
